	<p><b>Goal:</b></p>
	<br>
	<p>My goal is to present what I've worked on as a junior web developer and
	eventually get hired gaining as much experience as I can so further down
	the line I can work for a Developer Studio.</p>

	<p><b>Persona:</b></p>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Name:</b> Geralt Riviera</li>
		<li><b>Age:</b> 21</li>
		<li><b>Job:</b> Junior Web Developer</li>
		<p><b>Technology:</b></p>
		<li>iphone8plus with iOS12</li>
		<li>Desktop with Intel Core i5-8265U Processor, GTX 1070, and 16gb ram.</li>
		<li>HP Laptop with Intel Core i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz, Intel UHD Graphics 620.</li>
<div>
		<p><b>Attitude:</b></p>
		<li>One of the many frustrations they deal with is self doubt. Even when they're in a good situation they believe
		somehow it will end badly. It's natural with people but it ultimately depends on how the person deals with it.
		Through dedication and hardwork, Geralt has his portfolio to show he didn't let stress get to him.</li>
	<p><b>Goals:</b></p>
		<li>Geralt's main goal is for a great tech company to look over his portfolio and eventually hire him. He wants
	to spend as many years as he can to gain experience. Through years of working and making connections he hopes to one
	day work for a Developer Studio. It would be a different experience, but important for him to learn. Further down the
			line he hopes to one day own his own studio.</li>
